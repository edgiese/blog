This is a continuation of 
[this dialog](https://goodlifeodyssey.com/why-not-make-america-christian)
concerning whether it is consistent of a Christian to want to make the 
government Christian, if one had the power.

**Aaron**:  I had a revelation after our discussion yesterday about
whether a Christian ought, if she had the power, to make the government
of the United States (or any other country) Christian.

**Dijon**: I'm interested to hear it.  I don't think you did much more than
bluster during our last coversation.  I'm still thinking it would be 
consistent for a Christian to want this, regardless of anyone's fondness
for the U.S. Constitution.

**Aaron**:  Well, it's hard.  I'd like to just quote the Bible, but you see, 
the New Testament was completed while Christians had no political power
at all.  In fact, persecution was more common during the apostolic age
than anything like power.  So the Bible doesn't give advice to Christian
leaders at all.

**Dijon**: But we were not talking about _exercising_ power, but _gaining_
power.  The question is whether a Christian should try to control the
government and make it Christian.

**Aaron**: Yes, precisely.  Paul tells Christians to respect the governing
authorities in Romans 13 and to pray for those in power in 1 Timothy.  There
are other passages as well.  But none of them ever say to take over the
government.  From this, I'd say it is not recommended that a Christian
actively try to take over the government.

**Dijon**: Respect those in authority, sure.  But that doesn't mean one can't try to take over, right?

**Aaron**:  Come on.  Do you think you should pray for those in authority at
the same time you are trying to take their jobs from them?

**Dijon**: So then, George Washington was sinning when he rebelled against
the English authorities?

**Aaron**:  Some people thought so at the time.  But it is more subtle than
that.  I'm going to try to stop blustering, and explain it.  The best way
I can think to understand it is that Christians cannot change God's authority
or laws, any more than one could move a star in the sky.  What the Bible
told the early Christians was that the secular authorities were also agents
of God, so that their "stars" were also to be viewed as unchangeable.

**Dijon**:  That seems to make the Christians look like they _enjoy_ being
powerless.  So, you seem to be trying to avoid my question simply by
saying that Christians should not seek authority.  OK, I'll do one better, 
then.  What if a Christian woke up and found herself in authority?  Like
when Constantine converted to Christianity? I mean, he was already the 
emperor, but now he was the emperor and a Christian.  So what was he 
supposed to do?

**Aaron**: As I said, the Bible did very little directly to guide someone
like Constantine.  The problem was, Christians were pretty much all powerless
while it was written, with a few exceptions, so there is not much advice
given to them.  But historically there have been three different solutions
that Christians have used to answer the question.

**Dijon**:  Now we're getting somewhere!  So what was the first solution?

**Aaron**:  Think of what I should do if _I could control one set of stars_
in the illustration I used above.  As an earthly ruler, I no longer live
under two sets of immovable stars, but I have one I can move and one I cannot
move.  The first solution might be called _aligning the stars._  In short,
it says that the Christian ruler's job is to make the earthly laws line
up as closely as possible with God's laws.

**Dijon**:  AHA!  I knew it!  That is pretty much to make the country Christian,
as I have been saying!  So, that brings our conversation to a close... oh,
but wait, you said there were two others.  And I suppose you prefer one of
them.  What was the second?

**Aaron**: The second is _abdication_.  It claims that if you found yourself
in a position of earthly authority, you should surrender it, because it is
only a matter of time before you were corrupted as the world is.

**Dijon**:  This is kind of cheating.  You can't say that the answer to 
taking over the government is to not take over the government.  Plus, I'm not
sure I agree that any real people would do this.  Weren't you saying just
yesterday that we have to be practical?  Which groups ever did this?  I'm 
assuming that the Roman church is an example of the first solution.

**Aaron**:  You are right about the Roman church, although you
could include Calvin's Geneval in this category.  And examples of the second
group can be found among the anabaptists and their heirs, like the Mennonites
and the Amish.

**Dijon**:  Hmmm.  Everyone has heard of these groups, but they are not
really that significant in numbers.  But I suppose this is who you are going
to say we should follow?

**Aaron**:  No, not actually.  Because, you see, if you think about it, there
is not really any difference between the Amish and the Catholics in this
matter of aligning the starts.

**Dijon**: Wait, I thought you said one group said align the stars, and the
other said to abdicate.

**Aaron**:  But the abdication meant to withdraw into small communities, 
separate from the world, almost like a monastery enlarged to a town.  Within
these communities, they thought they could do an even better job of
aligning the constellations.  So, when you think about it, the abdicators
are just as enthusiastic about aligning constellations, but just more
pessimistic about doing it for large groups of people.

**Dijon**:  You really did seem to have some revelation.  Just last night
you were saying all kinds of things about not wanting to force others into
your beliefs, and now it's all about lining up stars and constellations.
But I imagine you've saved the one you actually agree with to last.

**Aaron**:  Of course, who wouldn't do that?  I've gotten you to listen to
me, right?  The last group of Christians said that God's will regarding
the running of the world is hidden, unlike His revealed Word for the church,
and the two should not really mix.  The revealed Word is, in the end, 
all about grace and forgiveness, which makes a beautiful way of running
a church, but a pretty impractical way of running a country.

**Dijon**: You know I'm not a huge believer in grace even as a religion, but
OK.  So, this is a first-rate dodge.  You say you don't believe in 
abdication, but you also don't believe that Christians should presume to
run the world because God's will there is hidden.

**Aaron**:  But I didn't say that.  I said that you can't align the 
constellations if you are a Christian.  But if a Christian controls the laws,
then the goal shouldn't be to force everyone to believe, but rather to allow
Christians to live peaceful lives in "Godliness and holiness" as it says in
1 Timothy 2.

**Dijon**: I'm not sure I see how this is any different from what I am saying.
If a Christian is supposed to encourage, with laws, for people to live
in "Godliness" and "holiness" isn't that the same as making the country
Christian?

**Aaron**.  No.  I'm trying to speak precisely here, I'm sorry, let me clarify.
A Christian should govern to _allow Christians_ to live this way, not _force_
anyone else to.  It is the ultimate religious liberty.  And it is not about
faith, as good as this is, but rather competence.  A well ordered society is
the best for people to come to faith, not by compulsion, but by attraction.

**Dijon**: And which Christian group practiced this?

**Aaron**: Lutherans.

**Dijon**: I should have guessed.  You seem to idolize those guys.

**Aaron**: Haha, no I don't idolize them.  And they weren't always that great
about doing this, in fact.  They were always slipping into the trap of
telling Christians that even if the government was rapacious, capricious,
and unjust, they should pray for them and live by the laws anyway.

**Dijon**:  Hmmm... maybe it's better to do it the Catholic way.

**Aaron**:  I don't think so.  But I'm sure you're tired of me talking
about this.  Let's talk about another wrinkle in my revelation that
makes the subject even more interesting, but later.

**Dijon**:  Sure, I still want to hear about George Washington,
and how, according to your explanation, he wasn't sinning.  But
for now, I gotta go, too.  Later!
