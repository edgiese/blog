> 26 “But when the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, he will bear witness about me. ...
> 
> “I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. 5 But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ 6 But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. 7 Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. ....
> 
> 12 “I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. 13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. 14 He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. 15 All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.

_Note:  When I preached this sermon, I had as an illustration a birthday cake for the church with about 100 candles on -- 
a candle for 20 years._

Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God our Father and from our Lord and Savior
Jesus Christ.  Our text is the gospel reading for today that we heard just
a few minutes ago, and I want to start by continuing, in a more grown-up way,
the children's sermon that you heard, too.  On the occasion of a birthday,
we who are a little older than those kids are might be inclined to look at
the candles, and look back over our lives, and reflect on how things have
gone, and ask what future candles will be representing.  Will they good years
or bad ones?

American Christians today could be forgiven for feeling that, perhaps, many of the
happier years are sitting there already as candles on the cake, and the candles
yet to be lit, in another year, will be representing sadder ones.  I was
talking to a friend this past week, and we both agreed that it seems that
_everyone_ appears to be grouchy, out of sorts, in a bad mood these days.  I
don't know for _certain_ if it's COVID hangover, or cultural uncertainty, 
or something else.  I have some strong suspicions though, which I'll share
in a bit.

The story is told of three friends who went to different colleges.  I'm going
to leave the names of the colleges out, so you can fill in blanks with your
own choices once you have heard the story:

> The three friends were on spring break, and
short on cash, and found themselves close to the water, but not able to afford
anywhere much fun or anything to do, so they were walking around in an
industrial area near the docks.  There was a sign on a door they walked by
saying, "Harbor tours, $5."
> 
> The first one said, "I don't know, it seems too good to be true."
> 
> The second one said, "don't be such a wet blanket, it's spring break, 
> maybe it's a volume discount sort of thing.  What do you
think," he asked the third one, who simply replied, "I'm not sure what to 
think."
> 
> So the second friend said, "I'm going in," and didn't come out.  The
first friend asked the third, "do you think we should follow?"  And he again
answered, "I'm not sure."  So the first friend went in.  
> 
> Finally, after a long pause, the third one also went through the door, where like the other two,
he was hit from behind and knocked out.  All three came to on a life raft,
without their money or much of anything, floating out in the bay.  
> 
> "I _knew_ this was a bad idea, the first one said."  
> 
> The second one said, "stop being such a downer, I'm sure they're going 
> to send someone out to pick us up."
> 
> The third one said, "No, they're not.  I did this last year."

It would be a great American sermon if I used this text to tell you,
somehow, that of course they were going to send a boat out to pick us up.
We Americans love a happy ending, and we're addicted to the idea, I'm not
sure where it came from, that with progress and human cleverness, things
will just keep getting better and better forever.  But we need to be realistic
about some of the candles on this cake here.

I did a little online research, and I discovered that many historians agree
that 536 was perhaps the worst year to be alive
in the northern hemisphere.  A volcanic eruption in 
Greenland or somewhere in North America put so much ash in the air that the
sun's rays were blocked.  Snow fell in June, and no crops survived for 
three years.  Many died of famine.  Just six years later, the Eastern Roman
empire, barely recovered from this awful weather event, was struck by the
first wave of a bubonic plague that killed about a third of the population.
The Roman empire was Christian at that point; in fact, the ruins remain today
of a huge church whose construction was halted by that plague and never
resumed.  I wonder what
those unhappy Christians thought as they were recovering from famine only
to face the plague.  No, things don't always just get better and better.

Our text says a lot about how we should look at the candles on the cake.
I think it is a great time, as we remember the coming of the Holy Spirit,
to think that this same Spirit is active in our own time.

Pastor Ely preached last week from the same portion of John's gospel as 
we read today.  Our readings don't always move forward; in fact, last week's
reading actually comes after today's.  But Pastor Ely spoke about how
John was remembering Jesus and writing his Gospel for people who felt that
the world was a hostile place for their beliefs.  By the time John was
writing this Gospel, even though the events he remembers and describes 
happened _before_ pentecost, the people who first heard his gospel regarded
that first day of the church as a distant memory, or perhaps had not even
been born when it happened.  The Holy Spirit came down with great power
and enthusiasm (if I may use that word) on that day of the first thousands
added to the church.  There were many days afterwards, though, that were just
ordinary days, both good and bad.

Jesus says, as part of this same talk he gives to His disciples, "In a
little while you will not see me, then a little longer, and you will."  When
we read this prediction of Jesus, from our vantage point, we assume that 
Jesus is talking about how he will be killed, and the disciples will not 
see Him until He comes again at Easter.  But many in the age of the apostles
could be forgiven for remembering these words of Jesus and thinking that He
would return very soon, perhaps any day.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of
those on the first Pentecost of the church weren't more expecting Jesus to 
return, rather than the Holy Spirit to come.

I think that many Christians in the age of the apostles would have been
horrified and disappointed if they realized that the Father intended to
put _so many candles_ on the cake.  Many of them would have acted very
differently, and perhaps the church would have have even survived.  The
apostles themselves, in that upper room, obviously had no idea what was 
going to happen at all, so it seems strange that Jesus would say they He 
had given them His Word.  There was a lot of the Word they didn't get.

And, in fact, it's well worth noticing that Jesus says that they are not 
meant to know everything all at once.  "I still have many things to say
to you, but you cannot bear them now."  It certainly doesn't make much sense
that things were going to get so incredibly happy for the church, that they
couldn't "bear them."  We don't use those words when we're talking about
good things.  It's something I've noticed years ago, that when a spouse or
a long friend or loved one dies, that people think they're over it when
they're not.  Suddenly a billboard, or a plate of food, or some other 
seemingly unrelated something brings back memories, and the grief is 
suddenly real again, tears and all.  Perhaps you've experienced this.  I
have.  What is going on, in my mind, is that God gives us grief on the
installment plan.  If we had to do all of our grieving for a very close
person all at once, it would kill us, as I have also witnessed.  So, Jesus knows of
what He speaks when he says, "you cannot bear them now," and He doesn't mean
it's because it's all so wonderful.

So, then, how did Jesus mean to continue to share?  Our Lord and Savior
talks to us through His Word most clearly, but also through things that
happen in our lives, and it is often here where it is so hard to bear.  But he does
not leave us alone.  The ESV translates the word Jesus uses for the Holy
Spirit as "Helper," but the most literal translation is "advocate," which word
itself comes from the Latin "ad" and "vocate", or "one called alongside."
In fact in the original language, the word, _paraclete_, means exactly this,
"one called along side."  The Holy Spirit is called to our side to make
the things Jesus says bearable -- to help us bear them.

Jesus says of the Helper, "he will declare the things that are to come."  This
sounds like predicting the future, or what we would call prophecy -- and 
surely the Holy Spirit has done this -- but another more common occurrence is 
another way to take those words, which is that the Holy Spirit helps us
understand those candles as they move from the future to the present, and
helps us bear them, especially when we need comfort or encouragement to do so.
Brothers and sisters, I submit to you that this is truly what empowers
the church and sets it apart from the world -- this Holy Spirit, this Helper,
this Advocate, who is called to our sides and makes the unbearable into
something bearable.

I don't want to go into detail about Jesus' words this morning about how
the Holy Spirit confronts the world.  To us, in the church, the Holy Spirit
is a beloved advocate, giving life and explaining God's work to us.  To the
world, however, the Holy Spirit shows a different face:  one that _convicts_.
The Holy Spirit convicts the world with regard to sin, and righteousness,
and judgment.  Occasionally -- for some of us, frequently -- we fall back
into the world's way of thinking about things, and when we do, we suddenly 
see this other side of the Holy Spirit.  It convicts _us_ when we are in 
the wrong.

We moan and complain to God about the bad things in our lives, despite the
overall evidence that we are wealthy, comfortable, and free from many of
the terrors that beset our ancestors and Christians of old.  When that happens,
we stop trusting in God and try to make the world in our own images, and it
never works.  We simply find ourselves separated from God.  But the Holy
Spirit convicts us with regard to righteousness, which is to say, He shows
us Jesus dying on the cross, and we see that God both loves us and wants
us to repent.  This is the source of all true life.  Put your faith in Jesus
and you will watch the Holy Spirit go from convictor to advocate.

Along with life, the Holy Spirit brings _hope_.  We are talking in our
midweek Bible studies about Peter's first letter, and that letter focuses
on _a living hope_ which we have in Jesus.  All of us "hope" that 2021 will
be better than 2020.  But we honestly have no guarantee that it will be.
Time will tell.  But the _living hope_ that the Holy Spirit gives us is 
sealed in heaven, where our Savior lives and sits who died for us.  This
isn't just some empty hope for a better tomorrow, but the certainty that
Jesus rose from the dead, and because of this, we are free from the 
sin and its attendant death that used to cloud around us like flies around
livestock.  Who wouldn't want that?

It must have been great to be there on the first day of Pentecost and
see the tongues of fire, like the little candles on the cake, on the
heads of the disciples.  It must have been amazing to see the well-known
phenomenon of ecstatic speech, as it existed in Jesus' day among many Greek
religions, turned into something beautiful as, instead of words no one
could understand, people of every language heard the truths and glories of
God told them in a way that tugged on their heart strings.  But, you know,
we don't have it so bad.  We have all those candles to look at, and while
those early Christians could not bear the knowledge of all that was to come,
the Holy Spirit has made it known and comforted the church for centuries.

We're not out of the woods.  If you want to think the way the world
thinks, there is always plenty to worry about.  For
my part, I worry a lot about these phones we all carry around.
I think that the technology is amazing, and I'm going to use it
as best I can to spread the Gospel even, but the technology is so
new that we don't understand yet how dangerous it might be.  Remember
how I said everyone is grouchy?  I think the phones may have as 
much to do with it as COVID.  We'll need to find out, and I pray to God
that the damage from overusing or misusing phones and their
technology isn't as great as a plague or a famine, but it could be,
it could be.

A few sentences after our
reading today, Jesus says to his disciples, "in this world you will have
trouble."  He surely spoke the truth.  But He immediately followed that 
by saying, "but take heart, for I have overcome the world."  Oppressed
Christians through the years have sung beautiful songs, like "we shall
overcome."  It is true, we "shall," by God's grace.  But with the Helper
at our side, it is also true that we _have_ overcome.  Your hope is
in front of you!  Let's march out with it in confidence.  Amen.
