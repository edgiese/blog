**_Note_: This post is one of a series of 'foundation' posts I hope to write, where
I share something I've learned through the years and have frequently repeated.**

There are two dangers, like two ditches on either side of a narrow path, which we
encounter when we pray.  The dangers both involve our expectation of how God is going
to respond to our prayer.

The first danger is **fatalism**.  This is the danger of the person who will say,
"God answers every prayer, but with yes, no, or wait."  Those three responses exhaust
every _possible_ outcome.  We may as well be praying to a rock, or a statue.  The same
"answers" will always come from anything, or anyone, you might pray to, because there are
no other possible answers than "yes," "no," or "wait."  This observation is thus 
meaningless.  Not harmful, perhaps, but not helpful, either.

Fatalism is also a danger for peoplw who emphasize strongly that every prayer should
end with the words, "Thy will be done."  This is obviously a petition in the prayer Jesus
taught us, and it is not meaningless (like the "yes, no, wait" claim above).  Many
people, though, misunderstand Jesus' words.  He is _not_ telling us that we ought to
stop and remind ourselves before we finish praying that the Father will not change His
behavior because we asked Him to, or that He is going to do whatever He does regardless
of our prayer.  No, Jesus is having us ask that the Lord break down every barrier that
does not want God's name to be holy, or His name to be hallowed.

What fatalism does is get us to believe, before we even rise from our knees, that
God has many reasons to ignore us, and we should just buck up and prepare to learn
of an answer we don't like.  Such prayer may be "deep" and "spiritual," but it is so 
draining that eventually it will sap us of our energy.

The second danger is **manipulation**.  This is the danger of people who pull out verses
such as, "in that day, you will ask the Father whatever you want in my name, and the 
Father will hear you."  Even the holiest of our prayers can be tainted with selfishness.
The woman who prays that her husband will attend church may spend more time thinking
of how nice it would be to sit with him in the pew, and not so much how God is missing
him if he stays home.

This ineradicable selfishness does not enter into the theology of the manipulators.  They
claim, boldly and happily, that if one prays with sufficient faith, one will receive
the desire that one pours out to God.  When disappointments ineviatably come, the
manipulator says, "you did not pray with sufficient faith."  Here, unlike the fatalist,
it is all up to us, rather than being up to God.  Many have lost their faith, or had it
weakened to the vanishing point, because they mistakenly believed that they could pray
in faith an restore sick children, or perform nearly miraculous deeds.

I think that the fatalist is not really different from the manipulator.  Instead, the
fatalist _anticipates_ possible failure, and reinforces against the disappointment with
the arguments above.  The manipulator is more innocent, but also a bit more selfish.
There is no reason to think one is better than the other; but they do have differing
opinions, and may not always get along.

The way to avoid these two ditches is to realize that God never really says "no" to us,
but rather that He has something _even better_ in mind.  Jesus famously in the garden
of Gethsemane asked for a way out of the suffering and humiliation He faced; there
was no relief for Him there, but what He got was much better in the end.  Similarly,
Paul says that God declined to remove his "thorn in the flesh," but it is noteworthy
that Paul did not consider this an offense of God, but rather something to brag about,
because God tole Him directly that weakness of the infirmity was better than strength.

Every time you pray for someone or something, you should get up positive that the prayer
will be answered.  When you are disappointed, do not be shy about bringing your
complaint to God.  He is faithful, and this expectation will lead -- after some
regrettable heartache in some cases -- to a greater awareness of How God works,
which is the mystery of the ages.
