David has a provocative little entry in his blog titled [Faith and Righteousness](goodlifeodyssey.com/faith-and-righteousness).  It is so short that I can quote it in full:

```
Two people do the same good deed—the first believes they will be rewarded, while the second is unsure. Which deed is more righteous?

Two people live equally charitable lives—the first is a Christian with a strong faith, the second is an agnostic. Which person is more righteous?
```

I ran this assertion by a friend, and he didn't have an immediate answer, even though this friend is a knowledgable Christian.  So on the surface, I say, "good job, you found a difficult question."  Of course, though, I started thinking about it myself, and I think that my initial response to these two questions is, "you are assuming facts not in evidence."

First, for my own assumption.  Since the two questions are posed by themselves, with parallel construction, I _assume_ that David means to assert an equivalence between the first question and the second one.  In other words, his implication is that Christians are less righteous than agnostics, because they believe that their acts of righteousness will be rewarded.  This is what I'm _assuming_ the argument is here.

Second, let me give this argument its due.  It's a strong emotional argument.  It plays off the situation -- played out in countless dramas real and imagined -- of someone who has figured out a hidden game being played and games it.  Mom and Dad are looking to see who will spontaneously clean their room to find out who gets to choose where they go out for dinner.  So one child, knowing that the command to clean the room is not far behind, gets the jump and gets the choice.  The whole situation seems unfair -- the one child knew something the others did not, and acting not virtuously, but out of self-interest.  No one likes that kind of kid.

We just read an appointed Gospel lesson in church that relates directly to this claim and situation.  In Matthew 25, Jesus is describing judgment day, as the people of the world are separated into two groups.  The judge's interaction with the righteous includes this portion:
