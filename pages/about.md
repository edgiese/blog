## About this Blog

I have been fascinated with blogging since it first sprang on the schene decades ago.  I was an early adopter and enthusiastic reader of many blogs, and still am.  I dipped my toe into commenting, and made a few tries at writing my own blog, but not much came of those efforts.

Looking back now, I see some of the roadblocks that I ran
into.  What is more, there seems to be a need for a
renewal in blogging.  Time will tell if this next effort
of mine will go the way of my earlier tries, but in the
mean time, I must thank my own sons for inspiring me
with their own blogging efforts, which are much better 
than my earlier attempts, perhaps because I think they 
are all better men than I am.

I thought about some titles, but decided for an eponymous
blog.  It's a way of overcoming one of the roadblocks I
have faced.  This blog is dedicated first to God, to Whom
I owe everything, and then to my sons, who have shown
me the way.

### Technology
A few years ago I worked for WP Engine, which is a high-end
web hosting company focused on Wordpress.  I think Wordpress
is a great platform, but it seemed better to challenge myself
with something different.  So I am building this blog
with next.js and publishing it with netlify.
