# Your Privacy

### Information collected
TL;DR: This blog is intended to disseminate my (Ed Giese's) thoughts and to 
facilitate discussion of them.  I do not put ads on the page, nor am I currently 
seeking any payment for my thoughts.  All of the data that this site collects 
is for the purpose of monitoring how I'm doing (traffic, from where and how much, 
not personal details) and what is needed to offer comments and moderate them.

If you upload a document, it is stored only so long as is necessary to convert
the document and is deleted immediately after your request is completed.

### Information collected automatically
* This site uses Google Analytics to track anonymous usage information. Your
  information may be subject to their [third-party terms](https://google.com/analytics/terms).
* This site does _not_ track information directly from anyone using it.  It is 
  hosted by [netlify](https://netlify.com), which may do some tracking for 
  their own purposes.
* The comment system is provided by [facebook](https://facebook.com), which has
  their own terms of service for their commenting system.

### How I use the information that Google collects
Google analytics data provides traffic information that I use to judge how 
well my posts are doing and how many people are reading them.  I cannot tell
from the analytics information who is reading, just how many and approximately 
from where.

### A note on security
I consider this blog a public forum, and anything I post here can be shared. I
expect that anyone quoting the material will adhere to the copyright, and 
provide attribution.

This site is not intended for use by anyone under 13 years of age.
